<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
    Merab Dvalishvili (Georgian: მერაბ დვალიშვილი [ˈmerab ˈdʷaliʃʷili]; born January 10, 1991) is a Georgian and American professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the bantamweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is the current UFC Bantamweight Champion. Dvalishvili is considered as one of the greatest Bantamweights of all time.[7][8][9][10] He is also the first Georgian-born champion in UFC history.[11] As of July 1, 2025, he is #3 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.[12]

Dvalishvili's UFC career began with two losses against Frankie Saenz and Ricky Simón.[13] Since then, he has been on a 13-fight win streak—tied for the fourth longest in UFC history[14]—defeating former champions, including José Aldo, Petr Yan, and Henry Cejudo.[15] On September 14, 2024, Dvalishvili captured the UFC Bantamweight Championship with a unanimous decision victory over Sean O'Malley.[16] He has since defended the title twice—first against Umar Nurmagomedov,[17] and then in a rematch with O'Malley, finishing the former champion via submission.[18]

Nicknamed "The Machine", Dvalishvili is known for having exceptional cardiovascular fitness and muscular endurance. This enables him to compete at a high-pace and attempt a large amount of takedowns for the duration of a contest without major adverse effects to his speed, technique or overall demeanour. Dvalishvili holds the record for most total takedowns in UFC history, with 97 landed during his time in the promotion. [68]

Dvalishvili often utilises attacks in the clinch, landing knees to the thighs of his opponents up against the cage wall or short punches in transitions. In the open space he will often threaten with spinning attacks, such as the spinning back-kick or backfist whilst also utilising the persistent threat of his takedowns to land punches on his opponent.

Starting with his fight against Henry Cejudo in 2024, Dvalishvili became known for showboating during fights; Some examples of this include talking to Mark Zuckerberg while grappling with Cejudo,[69] kissing Sean O'Malley on the head near the end of a round,[70] and taunting Umar Nurmagomedov after a successful takedown near the end of their fight.
